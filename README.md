# Agentic_AI_Numpy
- NumPy Mastery: From Basics to Advanced

- This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python codes demonstrating the usage of NumPy, the foundational package for numerical computing in Python. Whether you're just getting started or looking to deepen your understanding, this repo covers:

✅ Basic concepts (arrays, indexing, slicing, datatypes)

🔁 Intermediate topics (broadcasting, vectorization, statistical operations)

⚡ Advanced techniques (linear algebra, Fourier transforms, performance optimization)

📘 Real-world examples and mini-projects using NumPy

# 📆 Day 1: Core NumPy Concepts

## 🔢 Array Creation & Conversion
- Creating NumPy arrays using `np.array()`
- Converting Python lists to NumPy arrays

### 🔁 Predefined Arrays & Range
- `np.arange()` – Create sequences of numbers
- `np.zeros()` – Arrays filled with zeros
- `np.ones()` – Arrays filled with ones

### 🔲 Multi-dimensional Arrays
- Creating 2D arrays (matrices)
- Creating 3D arrays
- Creating N-dimensional arrays using `ndmin`

### 🎲 Random Number Generation
- `np.random.rand()` – Random floats between 0 and 1
- `np.random.randint()` – Random integers in a given range

### ✂️ Slicing & Indexing
- Accessing specific elements in arrays
- Slicing arrays (1D, 2D, and 3D)
- Indexing techniques

### 🔄 Reshaping Arrays
- Reshaping arrays with `.reshape()`
- Flattening arrays using `.ravel()` and `.flatten()`
